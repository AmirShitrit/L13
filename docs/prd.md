# Product Requirements Document: Command-Line AI Agent for Tool Testing

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a command-line AI agent designed to assist developers in testing Python functions (referred to as "tools"). The agent will facilitate the execution of these tools, gather feedback from the user about the outcome, and save this feedback to a file for later review.

## 2. Goals

*   To create an AI agent that helps users test and validate Python tools via a command-line interface.
*   To allow the agent to execute Python functions (tools) based on user input.
*   To gather and persist user feedback on the execution of tools to improve their quality.
*   To ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys, are not exposed in the codebase.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a tool developer, I want to be able to type a command in my terminal to test a specific tool.
*   As a tool developer, I want the agent to prompt me for feedback after a tool runs so I can record its performance.
*   As a tool developer, I want the feedback I provide to be saved to a file so I can track issues and improvements over time.
*   As a security-conscious developer, I want to make sure that the agent's API key is kept secret.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Functional Requirements

*   The system shall provide a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the agent.
*   The agent shall accept free-text input from the user to select and execute a tool.
*   The agent will be composed of an LLM and a set of Python functions (tools).
*   The agent shall be able to determine which tool to use based on the user's input.
*   The agent shall be able to pass arguments to the tools based on the user's input.
*   The system shall execute the selected tool and return the output to the user.
*   After a tool is executed, the agent shall prompt the user for feedback.
*   The agent shall save the user's feedback to a file named `feedback.md`. The feedback should include the name of the tool, a timestamp, and the user's comments.
*   There will be at least two distinct Python functions that can be used as tools.

### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Security:** The API key for the LLM must not be hardcoded in the source code. It must be loaded from a secure source, such as an environment variable or a configuration file that is not checked into version control.

### 4.3. Environment Requirements

*   The agent must be executed within a `uv` virtual environment to ensure dependency isolation and reproducibility.
